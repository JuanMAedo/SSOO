# SSOO
Projects of the OS of the 3ยบ year of the University 
All of them, will be using C and VSC


# Project 1 : Minishell #
Here, we had to develop a project in C with the objective of simulate a shell. 
We used a library to tokenize the I/0, and simulated the use of pipes and signals the commands like, normally, bash do it.
I try to use a estructure near to MVC, differences aside.

# Project 2 : Threads #
